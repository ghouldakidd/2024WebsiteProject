		<h2>Support</h2>
		The bill was sponsored by multiple members of the house, it was also sponsored by multiple different civil liberties 
		groups like the ACLU, CCIA, Competitive Enterprise Institute, Digital Liberity Organization and Electronic Frontier Foundation.
		A similar bill, was written by Senate Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy, a democrat, who wanted a bill to be created that requires
		only companies need an equivalent of a warrant before aquiring GPS data. Senators Al Franken and Richard Blumenthal wanted to create a 
		bill that would target app makers and device makers for GPS data. This in my opinion would be a step in a great direction. 
		<h2>Opposition</h2>
		The book "1984" by George Orwell has been floating around in the discussion of this bill and the governments access to GPS data. 
		I don't the comparisons are too far off, Several justices said that they were concerned that tech is giving federal agents way to much
		power into civilain lives. Social Media has also been called into question, is taking data publicly posted on the internet ok? What happens
		when you choose information that a suspect or another individual did not <b>want</b> to be posted and feels as if that is a violation of privacy?
