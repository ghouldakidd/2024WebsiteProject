		<h2>The Future of Geolocation Privacy and data</h2>
		As a whole, GPS tools and technology has brought so much utility to our day to day lives. Visiting a friend that's
		in a different town and you want to avoid traffic? Pull up Apple maps. You want an app that lets other drivers tell you
		where a police officer is hiding on the highway? Just open the Wayz app. Need to find dessert near you? Any gps map or web
		browser well be there for you in a pinch. No one, in any of the sources that I use or even myself are saying that GPS is an 
		outright negative, however, civilians have a right to be concerned about where the data is being sent, who is using it and why
		do any potential tools need it. 
		<br><br>
		It's one thing to trust if people inside an organization are using your data for the greater good, but what about people who 
		break in and use this highly sensitive data that includes things like daily routes, home addresses, work addresses and much more
		to harm you or the people around you. This applies to law enforcement as well, and while they may not break in to get access to your
		data, they certainly can abuse it. I hope and believe that a bill similar to this one will appear in another presidential administration
		very soon. Technology advances very quickly, and with AI being implemented to a wide variety of preestablished tools and devices, it's 
		only a matter of time before something goes haywire with such expiremental technology.
