		<h2>Information Privacy</h2>
		Information privacy or data privacy is a controversial topic, and is one of the most critical issues of today. 
		Fresh off the heels of an election, cybersecurity within the voting polls has also once again appeared in the news. 
		Privacy installs itself in every facet of our life, politically, socially, medically, financially and every other word 
		that ends with a <q>lly</q>. Many people underestimate the risks associated with poor data management practices. 
		Companies frequently collect, store, and monetize personal data, often without transparent consent from users, leading to breaches
		that expose sensitive information. Beyond financial implications, these breahces can also compromise individuals safety, reputations,
		and rights to privacy. As soceity becomes increasingly digital, prioritizing data privacy should be non-negotiable, ensuring that people
		retain control over their information and can trust the systems they rely on daily. 
		<br><br>
		Cyber attacks frequently target individuals as gateways to larger systems or as victims themselves. Governments and companies need stricter 
		regulations and ethical solutions to handle data responsibly, until then, I'll give you three ways to protect yourselves online.
		Be cautious about the personal information you share, such as taking pictures of where you currently are and posting them online for others to see.
		Keep devices and software updated, updates come with bug fixes and patches to vulnerabilities that may work on the old version that you are currently on. 
		The last piece of advice is to use virus scanners for files and websites that you want to visit, these scanners can be installed on your computer or 
		be a website you can visit that you can use to scan stuff on the fly.
