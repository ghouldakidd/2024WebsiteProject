		<h2>Illegal Surveillance</h2>
		Illegal Surveillance (or Unlawful Surveillance) is defined as a person intentionally uses or installs an imaging device to 
		secretively view, broadcast or record a person dressing, undressing, or engaging in sexual or other intimate conduct without
		another person's knowledge, when said person would otherwise have a reasonable expectation of privacy. Places where one would expect
		privacy could be, but not limited to: bedrooms, showers, restrooms, changing rooms or rooms assigned to guests.

		<h2>Maryland Audio Law</h2>
			An audio recording cannot be done without the consent of every person in that conversation, and everyone must be clearly told that there are
			being recorded. This applies for both in private and public areas. There is an exception for this rule which is for phone calls, where you might
			have heard a call center use a text-to-speech bot say "This call may be recorded for trainiing purposes". Under those circumstances it is legal 
			to record that phone call even though the person in question may not have agreed to be recorded. 
		<h2>Maryland Video Law</h2>
			It is (obviously) illegal to use hidden surveillance on others where the expect privacy, as stated previously. However, it is legal to record 
			your own property, whether it be indoors, your porch or your lawn, without alerting others that you have cameras up.
			<br>
			<br>
			Do you think that these laws are appropriate for the state?
